<h3>this image show all appliction and examples that use Artificial Intelligence</h3>  
<h2>examples :</h2>  

<ol>
<li><h3>Siri and Alexa</h3>
<p>
The challenge with voice-activated assistants – which play an ever growing role in business – is that they need to actually
 understand human speech. Even harder: they need to actually understand humans.

That’s where AI comes in. While the system engineers can build these voice assistants,

 they can’t embed the vast amount of human idiosyncrasy into them at launch. So these systems make heavy 
 use of machine learning to enable them to get better and better at the exceptionally complex task of human-to-machine interface.

Armed with AI, voice assistants will grow ever more capable of scouring the web, helping us shop, 
providing directions. There’s an expectation that this voice technology will power in-home assistants 
to help care for the elderly, which is among countless other examples of AI voice recognition.

<li><h3>Amazon and Online Commerce</h3>
<p>
The concept of a system that responds to customer input isn’t by itself an example of artificial intelligence.
 For example, those ads for shirts that follow you around the Internet after you’ve casually checked out shirts aren’t necessarily an advanced AI application.

But in the case of Amazon’s recommendation system, it’s a powerhouse of a transactional AI platform.
 You have likely observed its ability to learn – and keep learning – season after season. In essence,
 hordes of shoppers are “teaching” the Amazon AI system to better display likely items for sale. That is, 
 to match one item with another that the past has shown will prompt a sale. And to link semi-related concepts 
 (like, say, light stands with photographic equipment).

On a related note, this kind of cutting edge AI system needs a vast computing platform to process all that data.
 You don’t power a system like that with a small server farm. Clearly, Amazon Web Services has at its disposal a world-leading computing platform.

<li><h3>Nest</h3>
<p>
One of the key factors driving the growth of AI is the competition among deep-pocketed vendors to gain market share in these early days.
In the case of home thermostat Nest, owned by Google, part of the goal is build Google’s AI into the device – helping push back against 
the encroaching growth of Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa.

Nest uses AI to adopt to human behavior patterns, getting constant input clues and responding more accurately as it lives in the home.
Home owners make set the system manually for a period, then Nest incorporates input on its own.

In any case, smart home devices (a device connected to the Internet) are surely the key battleground in the battle for dominance of the AI market.
Getting an entire group of smart home devices to act in concert – responding to the family, learning based on user behavior – is clearly the future of AI in the home front.
