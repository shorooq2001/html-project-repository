<li><h3>Availability</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Machines don’t require frequent breaks and refreshments as like human beings.</li>
  <li>That can be programmed to work for long hours and can able to perform the job continuously without getting bored or distracted or even tired.</li>
  <li>Using machines, we can also expect the same kind of results irrespective of timings, season and etc., those we can’t expect from human beings.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Day to Day Application</h3>
<ul>
  <li> In our daily needs, a smartphone also becomes the 4th necessity for the human along with dress, food & shelter.</li>
  <li>If you are using a smartphone, it indirectly means that you are enjoying the AI by knowingly or unknowingly.</li>
  <li>Design the methods for automation by using learning and perception have become a common phenomenon in our everyday lives.</li>
  <li>We have our lady Siri for iOS devices or Cortana for Windows devices to help us out.</li>
  <li>We also prefer the help from GPS for the long drives and trips. </li>
  <li>A smartphone is one of the apt everyday examples of how we utilize the power of AI to reduce the barriers in a day to day life.</li>
  <li>In the part of utilities, we can find that how they predict what we are going to type and provide the suggestion to correct the human errors
  in spelling. That is one of the most used machine intelligence at work irrespective of industries and freelancers.</li>
  <li>While coming to the social media users based utilities, the artificial intelligence algorithm identifies and detects the person’s face and tags
  the individuals while we post the photographs on the social media sites.</li>
  <li>AI is widely deployed and utilized by the financial institutions and banking sectors to organize and manage data. Detection Of Fraud uses one
  of the best advantages of an artificial intelligence involvement in the smartcard-based system transactions</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Digital Assistance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Highly advanced organizations already implemented machines on behalf of humans to interact with their customers by using ‘avatars’. It is the 
  digital assistants or replicas which will help to reduce the need for human resources.</li>
  <li>For AI Machines, emotions only can be identified in the way of rational thinking.</li>
  <li>Robots can’t identify the sentimental factor of the user. It actually programmed for only
  think logically and take the right program decisions based on the existing experience taught to the machine.</li>
  <li>Emotions can’t be identifying by the machines that may be dissatisfying the customer. In that case, we need human
  intervention. This lagging tries to rule out for machine intelligence. But still, it helps in other aspects.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Handling Repetitive Jobs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Repeated jobs are tedious in nature. That kind of jobs can be easily handled with the help of AI algorithms. 
  These kinds of job don’t require much intelligence in between the process.</li>
  <li>Machines can think much faster than humans and can perform multi-tasking to obtain the best results.</li>
  <li>Machine intelligence can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks which may cause injury to the human involved in that.
  Their parameters can be adjusted is the benefit here. Their speed and time can be customized based on the requirement calculation.</li>
  <li>Whenever human operates the machine-like playing a game or run a computer-controlled robot, it means that we are actually interacting with AI Machines.</li>
  <li>In the computer game, the machine itself plays the game like as an opponent based on our activity in the game. The machine plans its movement based
  on the user response. So, we can say gaming is one of the most common uses of the advantages of artificial intelligence.</li>

<li><h3>Medical Applications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One of the great advantages of Artificial Intelligence is utilized in the field of medicine. We can identify the numerous numbers of medical 
  applications which rely on AI.</li>
  <li>Doctors/Physician assesses the patient’s health-related data and intimates the risk factors to the customers via the health care devices with 
  the help of artificial machine intelligence.</li>
  <li>It helps the patient to know about the side effects of different medicines and also behaves as personal digital care. Artificial surgery simulator 
  is the great innovation part of the AI. The efficiency of that always prefers to utilize that simulator by the Professionals for the treatment.</li>
  <li>Currently, we have huge software to detect as well as monitor the neurological disorders. It can simulate the functionality of the human brain.</li>
  <li>Robotics is used often in the treatment for mentally sick patients to come out from their depression also make them remain active in the real world.</li>
  <li>The current medical industry has the popular application of artificial intelligence is Radiosurgery. It helps us to operate the tumors 
  without damaging the unaffected surrounding tissues.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Hazardous Exploration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics are the fascinating advancements in technological development. Using this, we can able to handle 
  the huge volume of data for storing and processing but not limited to as well as we can use that in the process of mining and other fuel exploration processes.</li>
  <li>These complex machines can be utilized to overcome human limitations. We can utilize these machines as a replacement for the humans wherever we felt the 
  process done by the human is hazardous but can’t neglect that because of the goodness or results received.</li>
  <li>They can perform difficult tasks and accurate work with greater responsibility without any lag. Moreover, they do not wear out easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><h3>Hazardous Exploration</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reduction of Error</li>
  <li>The advantage of using Artificial Intelligence is, it helps us for error reduction and increasing the chance of reaching higher accuracy with a greater 
  degree of precision.</li>
  <li>It can be applied in various situations including the process called exploration of space.</li>
  <li>In that intelligent robots are fed with information because of the velocity of the data creation. Such kind of information forwarded to explore 
  the space. Even though those are machines with metal bodies, those are the most resistant in nature also it has a great character which can help us 
  to abide by the space and unfriendly atmosphere. Because of that, they used to create and acclimatize. It cannot be modified unknowingly or can’t get
  disfigured or breakdown in a hostile environment. In this scenario, we can’t neglect anything, by handling this we need to address this issue with the 
  efficient solution like Artificial Intelligence.</li>
